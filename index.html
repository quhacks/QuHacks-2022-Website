                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>A hackathon is a coding marathon - it's like a real-time programming fair where students develop an idea and bring it to life through code. A project could be a game, website, app, robot, Arduino project, whatever! If you enjoy programming or technology in general, hackathons are great places to meet friendly, like-minded people.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">> Do I need to know how to code?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No, you don't! Even if you aren't able to code beforehand, you can attend workshops, learn some code, and still submit a project. We will have both a novice division (set up specifically for those new to coding) and a main division, and the "Intro to Programming" workshop is tailor made for new programmers.</p>
